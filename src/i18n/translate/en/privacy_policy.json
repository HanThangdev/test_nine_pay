  "privacyNotice": "This privacy notice for Chatfly ('Chatfly AI,' 'we,' 'us,' or 'our'), describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share ('process') your information when you use our services ('Services'),such as when you:",
  "Visit": "Visit our website at chatfly.co, or any website of ours that links to this privacy notice.",
  "Engage": "Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events.",
  "QuestionsOrConcerns1": "Questions or concerns? Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us at contact@chatfly.co.",

    "QuestionsOrConcerns2": "Questions or concerns? Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us at contact@chatfly.co.",
    "question1": "1. What is the purpose of my data usage?",
    "answer1": "=> We utilize your data to train the bot to deliver responses that align with your preferences. Rest assured, we will never sell your data.",
    "question2": "2. Does OpenAI utilize my data for model training?",
    "answer2": "=> We do not engage in the training or fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), and OpenAI has explicitly stated that it will not use data provided by customers through its API endpoints for the purpose of training or enhancing models.",
    "question3": "3. Do you send my data to third-parties?",
    "answer3": "=> We use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 language models. This means that text content within your uploads may, in unmarked chunks, be submitted to OpenAI as context when generating a response. We will never send your documents in its complete original form to any other organization, including OpenAI or its partners.To better explain the associated implications, we like to use the analogy of mixing bags of legos (chunks of documents) and sending only a mix of blocks to OpenAI at a time. In the right combination, your blocks will form your original document (like a lego castle). However, when sending to OpenAI, your blocks can come from different documents, and they are sent alongside thousands of blocks from other users. There is basically no way (and no material benefit) for OpenAI to attempt reconstructing your blocks and learn of your original documents' content. OpenAI has also explicitly stated that it will not use data submitted by customers via its API endpoints to train or improve models.",
    "question4": "4. Can you view the documents I upload?",
    "answer4": "=> Our engineers have the capability to access the documents you upload. This access is for debugging and enhancing user experience purposes. Rest assured, all of our engineers are bound by strict non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), so your data will never be distributed in any way.",
    "question5": "5. Is my data end-to-end encrypted?",
    "answer5": "=> Your data is not end-to-end encrypted when it's stored on our servers. This is because encrypting your data would prevent us from extracting any meaningful information from it, which would disable most of our features. This holds true for text analytics platforms in general, including OpenAI itself. Anyone claiming to offer end-to-end encryption while providing similar capabilities is not being truthful.",
    "question6": "6. How can you access, modify, or remove the data we collect from you?",
    "answer6": "=> Depending on the laws in your country, you may have the right to request access to your personal information that we collect, make changes to it, or delete it. To request a review, update, or deletion of your personal information, please visit: contact@chatfly.ai."
