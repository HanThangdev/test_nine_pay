  "answer": {
    "answer1": "Yes, just by signing up you get 30 message credits and 1 chatbot (400k tokens). You can use these to test out chatbase and see if it works for you.",
    "answer2": "One AI response with gpt-3.5-turbo (the default) costs 1 message credit. One AI response with gpt-4 costs 20 message credits. You can change which model your chatbot uses in the chatbot settings. The difference is because gpt-4 costs 15x (prompt tokens) and 30x (completion tokens) what gpt-3.5-turbo costs on OpenAI.",
    "answer3": "One chatbot means a chatbot that contains specific data and can answer any question about this data. Even if it was created using multiple documents.",
    "answer4": "If your chatbot is private, only you have access to it. If you decide to make it public, anyone with the link will be able to interact with it",
    "answer5": "Your message credits are renewed at the start of every calendar month regardless of when you subscribed. So if you subscribe on the 15th of March, your credits will be renewed on the 1st of April.",
    "answer6": "Once you attach your document(s) for upload, chatbase will show you the tokens count of all the attached documents.",
    "answer7": "Yes, if you have a paid plan you can upload multiple files to one chatbot. Just click ctrl (windows) or cmd (mac) and select as many files as you want.",
    "answer8": "Free plan: 400K Tokens (~5MB) | Hobby/Standard/Unlimited: 11M Tokens (~140MB)",
    "answer9": "You get 40.000 message credits included in the plan when you subscribe. Every message after that will use your OpenAI API key that you can add in your account page. So you get the cheapest possible price per message after you hit the limit."
